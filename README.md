## Code Description

This code is a simple program to conduct a random draw among a group of participants to distribute prizes.

### Project Idea

The project idea is based on randomly selecting a winner from a group of participants, and then distributing a random prize to them. This process can be repeated to select more winners and distribute more prizes.

### Features

*   **Easy to use:** The program is simple and easy to use. It prompts the user to enter the names of the participants and then performs the draw randomly.
*   **Language selection:** The program supports both Arabic and English languages, and the user can choose their preferred language.
*   **Variety of prizes:** The program contains a variety of prizes, ranging from valuable prizes such as Hajj and Umrah, to other prizes such as discounts and shopping vouchers.
*   **Preventing previous winners from winning again:** The program can prevent previous winners from winning again, to ensure fair distribution.
*   **Repeating the draw:** The user can repeat the draw to select more than one winner and distribute more than one prize.

### Goal

The goal of this program is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool to conduct a random draw among a group of participants, and distribute prizes to them fairly and transparently.

### Future Enhancements

*   **Adding more prizes:** More diverse prizes can be added to the program, to meet the different needs of users.
*   **Customizing the number of participants:** The user can specify the number of participants in the draw, instead of being limited to a specific number.
*   **Saving results:** The program can save the results of the draw to a file, to allow the user to refer to them later.
*   **Adding a graphical interface:** A graphical interface can be developed for the program, to make it more attractive and easier to use.
*   **Integrating with databases:** The program can be linked to a database to store participant and prize information, and manage the draw more efficiently.
